README for UseModWiki 1.0
Last updated: August 1, 2003

Release notes:

Visit http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl for documentation and official
announcements regarding UseModWiki.  The current documentation is minimal,
but the developers and some users will try to answer any questions.

Please send questions or comments to usemod@usemod.com.

A mailing list for major UseModWiki announcements (releases and critical
bugs) is available.  Send mail to usemod@usemod.com to join the list.

------
Security:

Wiki administrators should be aware of the risks of enabling the HTML
or email options in UseModWiki.  Permitting full HTML editing allows a
malicious user to cause the browsers of other users to execute
arbitrary Javascript, Java applets, or other possible sources of
security holes.  The email option could be misused to send annoying
mail to third parties (since no validation is done on the email
addresses entered into the Preferences page).  These options may be
useful for small trusted groups, but they are not advised for wikis
open to the general public.
